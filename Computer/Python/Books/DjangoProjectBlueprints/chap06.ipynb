    "A basic e-commerce site has one main purpose: to help users find and buy products from the online store. Django alone can be used to build an e-commerce site quickly, using database queries to allow searches across product range, but this doesn't scale well. Databases are designed to quickly save and retrieve rows of data, but they are not optimized to search across the entire dataset (or a subset). Once the traffic of your site starts to increase, you'll see the search speed go down very quickly. On top of that, there are some features that are very difficult to build with a database."

    "Instead, we will use a **search server**. A search server is very much like a database. You give it some data to store and then you can retrieve it later. It also has features specifically built to help you add searching to your applications. You might wonder that if a search server can store our data like a database, then can we not just get rid of the database? We can, but usually it's not recommended. Why? Well, because the search server is designed for a different use case. While it can store your data, a database provides a lot of guarantees about the storage that a search server usually doesn't. For example, a good database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) gives you a guarantee that if you try to save something and the database returns a successful response, your data will not be lost in case of a crash or power outage or some other problem. This is called durability. A search server does not provide this guarantee because that's not what they are designed for. It is usually a good idea to keep our data in a database and use the search server just to search across our data."
