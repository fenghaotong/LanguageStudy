After that, we get the main part of the time. A messages file, ignoring the metadata and first pair (the one preceded by the fuzzy comment), is just a list of `msgid` and `msgstr` pairs. The `msgid` pairs is the string that you have marked for translation, and `msgstr` is the translation for that string. The usual method of translating an app is by first marking all the strings for translation, then generating the messages file, and finally providing it to the translator. The translator then returns the file to you with the translations filled in. The benefit of using a simple text file is that the translator doesn't need to use any special software. If he has access to a simple text editor, he can translate the messages file."

The binary file format is much quicker to read from for Django, and in projects with hundreds or thousands of translatable strings, these performance benefits add up very quickly. The output of the compile messages file is a .mo file in the same folder as the .po file."
